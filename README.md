# teachCovidData

This R package for getting familiar with COVID-19 data resources and their use was
inspired by work of Dr. Latrice Landry related to the 
[NIH Covid Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL)](https://covid19community.nih.gov/).

Learning objectives

- get comfortable with acquiring and exploring public datasets using R
- look specifically at temporal and geographic variations in impacts of COVID
- produce questions and projects related to COVID effects and responses

Important topics are not addressed, but comments and pull requests are welcome;
see the [issues tracker](https://github.com/vjcitn/teachCovidData/issues).
It would be very nice to have modules on

- environmental measures of population load, such as [wastewater monitoring results](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/NWSS-Public-SARS-CoV-2-Wastewater-Metric-Data/2ew6-ywp6)
- studies of [host genetics](https://www.covid19hg.org/partners/) of susceptibility to disease and complications
    - example [case-control analysis](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/152386/figure/2)
    - [critical remarks and schema for predictive genomic medicine](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/155011/figure/1)
- mobility metrics related to incidence variation (google's [historical data](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/), [example analysis](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb4218))
- types and effects of non-pharmacologic interventions ([CDC link](https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/index.html))
- [vaccination mandates](https://data.cdc.gov/Policy-Surveillance/State-Level-Vaccine-Mandates-All/kw6u-z8u2)
- incidence of [vaccination-related adverse events](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html)
- elaborations of elements on data publication and education in international contexts ([2021 overview](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.2021.0127), speculations on [data from China](https://www.science.org/content/article/china-flying-blind-pandemic-rages), [WHO overview](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019))
