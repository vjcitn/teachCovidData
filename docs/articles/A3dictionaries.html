<p>Data representation often involves various levels of explicitness. A “variable name” is a short token that can be used in programming to refer to some quantity or outcome or event of interest.</p>
<p>A data dictionary maps variable names to more explicit definitions of quantities, outcomes, events, and may include more information on context of measurement.</p>
